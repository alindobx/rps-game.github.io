<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Rock, Paper, Scissors was a childhood game I use to play when I was bored with my brother. 
Coding this game was fun and challenging all at the sametime. This app was a little more complex then
the last App, I use more if/else statements so I had to stay focused</p>

<p>I will be definitely revisting this Applications for some improvements</p>
